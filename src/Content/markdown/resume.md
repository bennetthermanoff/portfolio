# Welcome to my personal website!

Since I can remember, I have loved making absolutely anything. I have picked up so many projects over the years, and my skills have followed. 

I have a passion for learning new things, and I am always looking for new challenges. I am a quick learner, and I am always looking for new ways to improve myself. All of my skills stem from these projects, and because of this, I have gained a deep knowledge of so many different areas and technologies.

Lately, I have focused on Full-Stack development. It has proved to be the easiest way for my work to reach a large audience, but it is not my only skill. As my resume shows, I have worked in many different engineering fields, and can adapt to any project.

If you would like to reach out, feel free to contact me at [bennett@hermanoff.dev](mailto:bennett@hermanoff.dev). I am constanly updating this website as well, if you want to keep up to date on all my projects, you can also follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/xpsking).
