# fightStick

fightStick is a custom videogame bluetooth controller for playing fighting games.

I was disappointed with the quality of the controllers available on the market, so I decided to build my own. I wanted to make a controller that used all original components, had a good feel, and was easy to use. The case was designed in Fusion360 and 3D printed. The top and bottom of the case are laser cut acrylic. The controller is powered by an Heltec ESP32 LoRa V2 board. 

I used the Arduino IDE to program the ESP32 in C++. The code is available on [Github](). While the controller is in use, the OLED screen displays the current stick movement to help train users on how to perform motion inputs. The controller can be used with any bluetooth enabled device.
